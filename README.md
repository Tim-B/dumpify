# Dumpify #

## Uhhh, what? ##
__Dumpify is a spotify app which records all the songs you have listented to, then let's you dump them to a playlist.__
### Why is this useful? ###
It's most useful when you want to save radio stations into a playlist. Say you like a particular radio station, but need to save your music offline so that you can listen to it on your phone on your way to work. Simply leave dumpify running while you listen to that station over the weekend, then dump all the songs to a playlist and make that playlist available offline on your phone.
### Getting started ###
Using Dumpify is simple, all you have to do is press activate and Dumpify will start recording from the next song that starts playing. A list of tracks will then begin to appear below. Once you have enough songs, just click dump to playlist to create a new playlist from these tracks. You can remove tracks from your playlists once they have been dumped.
	
## Installing Dumpify ##
1. Download the files, rename the src directory to dumpify and copy it into a folder called Spotify under your user directory. (eg. on Windows index.html should sit at My Documents/Spotify/dumpify/index.html)
2. Restart Spotify if you already have it open (do this by going File > Exit and starting the application again)
3. Type spotify:app:dumpofy into the spotify search bar and hit enter.
4. Dumpify should now open, and you may be presented with the option to save the app to your sidebar.
5. Dumpify is now ready for use, if the app dissapears from the sidebar after restarting, repeat step 3.
